          Rockstar Games officially confirmed that it was working on GTA 6 back
          in February last year. It snuck the reveal at the bottom of a GTA 5
          Community Update, with one single line stating that "active
          development for the next entry in the Grand Theft Auto series is well
          underway". Talk about playing it down, eh? Since then though, we've
          had little else from Rockstar in any official capacity. Although,
          reports suggest GTA 6 could reportedly be announced "as early as this
          week," with a trailer next month, so prepare yourselves fans. On
          September 18, an unprecedented GTA 6 leak saw over 90 videos and
          screenshots from an early, in-development alpha build of the game
          surface online. Rockstar has acknowledged and authenticated the hack,
          and is working to scrub the leaked material from the internet.
          Naturally, this first look at Grand Theft Auto 6 has revealed some new
          details about the game including information on the GTA 6 location,
          characters, and gameplay. So keep on reading to find everything you
          need to know about GTA 6 so far.

          <h3>GTA 6 map</h3>
          <p>
            While the final GTA 6 map is yet to be shown, there are some
            indicators from the leaked video and screens that indicate a play
            space that stretches beyond the confines of Vice City. Much in the
            same way Rockstar expanded upon Los Santos between Grand Theft Auto:
            San Andreas and GTA 5, a few of the leaked screenshots appear to
            show all-new areas of Vice City. As you may know, Vice City itself
            is loosely based on Miami, and there's now speculation that GTA 6
            will push further south toward the Everglades (a wetland) and the
            Florida Keys (a string of tropical islands). Now, the "Gator Keys"
            were referenced in the original GTA: Vice City as part of a radio
            broadcast, but the location was never shown in-game. If the
            screenshots suggest what we think they are, expect the GTA 6 map to
            contain a mixture of environment types. Interestingly, fans are
            convinced that the GTA 6 map will be much larger than that of GTA 5.
            Using leaked GTA 6 coordinates, the GTA 6 subreddit fans are trying
            to map out the map itself, and later started stitching GTA 6's map
            together using Google Earth and Paint. Clever folks.

          <h3>GTA 6 characters: Will there be a GTA 6 female protagonist?</h3>
          <p>
            It has been rumored for months now that Rockstar was working on the
            first GTA 6 female protagonist - at least, a first for the series in
            the 3D era. A Bloomberg report from earlier this year, which
            explored the changing company culture within Rockstar North, first
            reported the news - and it has since been corroborated by the GTA 6
            leak. In the early development footage, we're able to see two new
            playable GTA 6 characters. The in-development names for the
            characters are Jason and Lucia, and it would appear that the
            character switching system from GTA 5 is returning in some capacity.
            One leaked clip showed the pair robbing a diner together, with the
            player in control of one of the characters while the other was
            piloted by AI. In another clip, we see character swapping - although
            it is near instantaneous, rather than the slow perspective shift as
            seen in GTA 5.
