          FAR CRY 6 - FREE WEEKEND AVAILABLE NOW          <br />
          <br />
          Far Cry 6 is available to play for free starting today until February
          20 on Xbox Series X|S, Xbox One, PS5, PS4, and PC. In the game, you'll
          step onto the tropical island Yara and take on the role of Dani Rojas,
          who joins the guerrilla group Libertad and helps them work to
          overthrow Yara's dictator, Ant√≥n Castillo. Dani's work will take them
          all over the island, showing off its diverse regions as they take out
          Castillo's army. The free weekend will give players access to all of
          Far Cry 6's base game, including the crossover missions inspired by
          pop culture: Rambo: All the Blood, and The Vanishing, a Stranger
          Things mystery. If you don't want your time in Yara to end after the
          weekend, Far Cry 6 will be on sale for up to 70% off for a limited
          time. Purchase the game after the free weekend ends, and all your
          progress will carry over.
          <br><br>
          During the free weekend, players
          can also play Far Cry 6 in co-op, joining forces with friends to
          liberate Yara. Everyone who plays co-op during the free weekend will
          receive the White Lotus Sniper Rifle, and those who play co-op but
          don't own the game will receive it in their inventory when they
          purchase it. Far Cry 6 is also part of Ubisoft Connect's Share Play
          program, a free new feature that allows you to share your screen and
          controls with friends virtually. For a limited time, get the Standard,
          Deluxe, and Gold Editions of Far Cry 6 for up to 70% off, the Game of
          the Year Edition for up to 67% off, and save up to 60% on the Game of
          the Year Upgrade pass and Season Pass. You can also get Far Cry 6's
          recent expansion, Lost Between Worlds, for up to 50% off. If you miss
          Far Cry 6's free weekend, don't worry - the game has an
          always-available free trial that gives you access to the full game,
          with progress limited to the first island. For more on Far Cry 6,
