          FIFA 23
          <br />
          <br />
          FIFA 23 is a football video game published by EA Sports. It is the
          30th installment in the FIFA series that is developed by EA Sports,
          the final installment under the FIFA banner, and released worldwide on
          30 September 2022 for Nintendo Switch, PlayStation 4, PlayStation 5,
          Windows, Xbox One and Xbox Series X/S. Kylian Mbapp√© and Sam Kerr
          are the cover athletes for the standard and legacy editions. Listed in
          Guinness World Records as the best-selling sports video game franchise
          in the world, the game is the final under the 29-year partnership
          between EA and FIFA. Future football games by EA are named under the
          banner of EA Sports FC (alternatively just "EAFC").<br /><br />
          HyperMotion2 and Technical Dribbling<br /><br />

          The game features what's being dubbed as "HyperMotion2", a system of
          match capture with machine learning from real life football matches to
          create over 6,000 in-game animations. "Technical Dribbling" uses what
          is being called the "Active Touch" system to improve the footballer's
          path to the ball and improve a player's turning and dribbling with
          more responsiveness. Both systems are exclusive to
          current-generation versions (i.e. PS5, Xbox Series X/S and PC). The
          machine learning algorithms used in HyperMotion2 are based on deep
          learning neural networks, which are designed to simulate the behavior
          of the human brain. These neural networks consist of layers of
          interconnected nodes that process and analyze data, allowing the
          system to identify patterns and make predictions based on past
          experience. To train the machine learning algorithms used in
          HyperMotion2, EA Sports used a large dataset of football matches
          captured with advanced motion-capture technology. The dataset includes
          thousands of hours of footage, which was carefully analyzed and
          labeled by a team of experts to ensure the accuracy of the data. A
          technique called backpropagation was used by EA Sports.
          Backpropagation is a technique used to adjust the parameters of a
          neural network to minimize the difference between the network's
          predictions and the actual output. In the case of HyperMotion2,
          backpropagation is used to adjust the parameters of the neural network
          to ensure that the in-game animations accurately replicate the
          movements of real-life players. The machine learning algorithms used
          in HyperMotion2 are able to identify patterns in the data and use
          these patterns to create new animations that accurately replicate the
          movements of real-life players. The system is able to generate over
          6,000 unique animations, each with its own set of variables and
          parameters that determine how the animation will be executed
          in-game. <br /><br />
          World Cup game modes<br /><br />
          FIFA 23 features the men's World Cup game mode and the women's World
          Cup game mode, replicating the 2022 FIFA World Cup and the 2023 FIFA
          Women's World Cup. This is the only title in the series to feature
          both World Cups as special modes. The 2022 FIFA World Cup mode was
          released on 9 November for all platforms except for the Nintendo
          Switch Legacy Edition. The mode contains only two out of eight
          stadiums: Al Bayt and Lusail Iconic Stadium. The mode also contains
          each of the 32 teams that qualified for the 2022 tournament, along
          with fifteen other national teams that are featured in the game and
          did not qualify: Austria, China, Czech Republic, Finland, Hungary,
          Iceland, Italy, New Zealand, Northern Ireland, Norway, Republic of
          Ireland, Romania, Scotland, Sweden, and Ukraine. The World Cup
          mode in FIFA 23 is the last World Cup mode since the new generation of
          FIFA games will go under the name of EA Sports FC; therefore will not
          get licensing from FIFA. On 19 June 2023, it was announced that the
          2023 FIFA Women's World Cup mode has been released around the end of
          June 2023. The update was released on 27 June 2023,
          replicating the 2023 FIFA Women's World Cup tournament and featuring
          the 32 qualified teams. <br /><br />
