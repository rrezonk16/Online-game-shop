          Dota 2
          <br />
          <br />
          Dota 2 is an Action RTS game, developed by Valve Corporation. The
          title was formally announced on October 13, 2010; and was released as
          a Free to Play game on July 9th, 2013 for Windows, and July 18th, 2013
          for Mac OS and Linux. It is the successor to the very popular Warcraft
          3 mod, Defense of the Ancients, which was based on the Aeon of Strife
          map for StarCraft.
          <br /><br />
          Dota 2 is an RTS-styled MOBA-type competitive team game with RPG
          elements. Two competing teams (Radiant and Dire) consist of five
          players each. The main objective in Dota 2 is to destroy the enemy
          Ancient inside their stronghold. These strongholds are protected by
          multiple towers down 3 lanes. Instead of building armies of units like
          in classical RTS games, each player controls a single Hero, a
          strategically-powerful unit with unique abilities and characteristics
          which can be improved over the course of the game. Experience is
          earned when nearby creeps and heroes die, and once collecting enough
          experience, the hero gains a level, which increases the hero's stats,
          and at most levels the hero gains a skill point which can be spent to
          unlock or upgrade one of the hero's abilities. Alongside a hero's
          fixed abilities, each hero has 6 inventory slots which can be filled
          with Items which provide various benefits and abilities. To purchase
          these items, Gold is gained passively over time, by killing creeps, by
          killing enemy heroes and by destroying buildings. Dota 2 has a heavy
          emphasis on tactics and team co-ordination, and a deep amount of
          strategy focused on building up strength as fast as possible, optimal
          itemization, and selecting what order to upgrade your hero's spells.
