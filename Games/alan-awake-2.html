          Alan Wake 2 is nominated for GAME OF THE YEAR at The Game Awards
          <br />
          <br />
          A string of ritualistic murders threatens Bright Falls, a small-town
          community surrounded by Pacific Northwest wilderness. Saga Anderson,
          an accomplished FBI agent with a reputation for solving impossible
          cases arrives to investigate the murders. Anderson�s case spirals into
          a nightmare when she discovers pages of a horror story that starts to
          come true around her.<br /><br />
          Alan Wake, a lost writer trapped in a nightmare beyond our world,
          writes a dark story in an attempt to shape the reality around him and
          escape his prison. With a dark horror hunting him, Wake is trying to
          retain his sanity and beat the devil at his own game. Anderson and
          Wake are two heroes on two desperate journeys in two separate
          realities, connected at heart in ways neither of them can understand:
          reflecting each other, echoing each other, and affecting the worlds
          around them. Fueled by the horror story, supernatural darkness invades
          Bright Falls, corrupting the locals and threatening the loved ones of
          both Anderson and Wake. Light is their weapon�and their safe haven �
          against the darkness they face. Trapped in a sinister horror story
          where there are only victims and monsters, can they break out to be
          the heroes they need to be? <br /><br />

          Solve a Deadly Mystery
          <br /><br />
          What begins as a small-town murder investigation rapidly spirals into
          a nightmare journey. Uncover the source of the supernatural darkness
          in this psychological horror story filled with intense suspense and
          unexpected twists.<br /><br />
          Play As Two Characters
          <br /><br />
          Experience both Alan Wake�s and Saga Anderson�s stories and see events
          unfold from different perspectives. Switch between Anderson�s
          life-or-death race to solve the case and Wake�s desperate attempts to
          rewrite his reality to escape the depths of the Dark Place
          <br /><br />
          Explore Two Worlds
          <br /><br />
          Experience two beautiful yet terrifying worlds, each with its own rich
          cast of characters and deadly threats. Discover majestic landscapes of
          Cauldron Lake in the Pacific Northwest and the idyllic towns of Bright
          Falls and Watery. Contrasting sharply, attempt to escape the
          nightmarish cityscape of the Dark Place.<br /><br />
          Survive With Light
          <br /><br />
          With limited resources, take on powerful supernatural enemies in
          desperate close-combat situations. It takes more than just a gun to
          survive: light is the ultimate weapon in the fight against the
          darkness and will be your refuge when enemies threaten to overwhelm
          you.
